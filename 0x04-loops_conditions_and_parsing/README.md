# 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing

Loops, conditions, and parsing are fundamental concepts in programming that allow you to control the flow of your code and manipulate data in various ways. Here's a brief overview of each of these topics:

## Loops:
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. The most common types of loops are:

For loop: Executes a block of code a fixed number of times, iterating over a sequence or a range of values.
While loop: Repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.
Do-while loop: Similar to the while loop, but it ensures that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.
## Conditions:
Conditions allow you to make decisions in your code based on whether certain statements are true or false. Conditional statements are usually used with loops and branching structures. The primary conditional statements are:

If statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
If-else statement: Executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.
Switch statement: Allows you to select one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of a variable.

## Parsing:
Parsing involves breaking down a string or a sequence of characters into meaningful parts or tokens. It is commonly used for data extraction, validation, and manipulation. The parsing process often involves defining rules or patterns to identify and extract relevant information from the input. Programming languages typically provide built-in libraries or functions for parsing strings, such as regular expressions or specific parsing libraries.
