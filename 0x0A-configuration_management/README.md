# 0x0A. Configuration management
Configuration management refers to the practice of systematically managing and controlling changes to the hardware, software, documentation, and other components of a system or product throughout its lifecycle. This process ensures that a system's configuration remains consistent, reliable, and well-documented, even as changes are made over time.

Key aspects of configuration management include:

    Version Control: Managing different versions of software, hardware designs, documents, and other assets. Version control systems like Git help track changes and allow teams to collaborate effectively.

    Change Management: Establishing a formal process to request, review, approve, and implement changes to the configuration. This prevents unauthorized or haphazard modifications that could lead to instability.

    Configuration Identification: Defining and labeling system components, ensuring they can be uniquely identified. This helps in tracking changes and managing different versions.

    Configuration Control: Enforcing a control mechanism to regulate changes. Changes must be reviewed, approved, and documented before implementation to maintain system stability and consistency.

    Configuration Status Accounting: Maintaining a record of the state of system components and their versions. This provides visibility into the system's history and current state.

    Configuration Auditing: Regularly reviewing the configuration to ensure it aligns with the intended design and complies with organizational standards and regulations.

    Configuration Verification and Validation: Ensuring that the configured system meets its intended requirements and performs as expected.

    Baseline Management: Creating and maintaining baseline configurations that represent stable points in the system's development. These baselines are used as references for future changes.

    Documentation Management: Keeping accurate and up-to-date documentation that describes the system's components, their relationships, and how they interact.

    Automated Deployment: Using automation tools to deploy and configure software and infrastructure, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistency.


## Puppet 
Puppet is a widely used open-source configuration management tool designed to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of servers, applications, and infrastructure. It allows administrators and DevOps teams to define the desired state of their systems and then automatically enforce that state across a range of servers and devices. Puppet uses a declarative language to describe the desired configuration, which makes it easier to manage and maintain complex infrastructures.
